0x02. Python - import & modules

In Python, a module is a file containing Python code. The code can 
define functions, classes, and variables, or it can execute statements. 
Modules are used to organize and reuse code in a structured way.

Here are some key points about Python modules:

Organization: Modules help you organize your Python code by breaking it into smaller,
manageable files. Each module typically focuses on a specific aspect of your program's functionality.

Reusability: Modules promote code reusability. You can create a module 
with functions, classes, or variables and then import it into other Python 
scripts to use those elements without rewriting the code.

Namespace: A module creates its own namespace, meaning that the functions,
classes, and variables defined in one module won't conflict with those in 
another module or the main script. You can access these elements using the module's name as a prefix.

Standard Library Modules: Python comes with a rich standard library
containing numerous modules for various purposes. These modules provide 
ready-made functionality for tasks such as file I/O, mathematical 
operations, working with dates and times, and more.

Third-Party Modules: You can also create your own modules or use 
third-party modules developed by the Python community to extend Python's 
capabilities. Third-party modules are often distributed through package managers like pip.
