# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Introduction

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. It is a way to model relationships between objects, where one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. In Python, inheritance enables code reuse, promotes the creation of a class hierarchy, and allows you to build more specialized classes while maintaining a consistent interface.

This project explores various aspects of inheritance in Python, including superclass and subclass relationships, method and attribute inheritance, method overriding, and the use of built-in functions like `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super`.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome.
- What is a superclass, base class, or parent class.
- What is a subclass.
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance.
- When can an instance have new attributes.
- How to inherit a class from another.
- How to define a class with multiple base classes.
- What is the default class every class inherits from.
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class.
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses.
- What is the purpose of inheritance.
- What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
