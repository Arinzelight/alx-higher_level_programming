# Python - Almost a Circle

## Background Context

The "Almost a Circle" project is designed to help you review and enhance your Python programming skills in preparation for the AirBnB project. Throughout this project, you will work on various aspects of Python, including:

- Import
- Exception handling
- Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Private attributes
- Getter and Setter methods
- Class methods
- Static methods
- Inheritance
- Unit testing
- Reading and writing files

You will also delve into more advanced topics such as:

- Understanding and using `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Serialization and deserialization of classes
- Working with JSON data
- Handling named arguments in functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts and perform related tasks without relying on external references:

### General
1. Understand the concept of unit testing and implement it in a larger project.
2. Serialize and deserialize a class, preserving its data structure.
3. Write and read data from a JSON file in Python.
4. Comprehend the use of `*args` and apply it in function definitions.
5. Understand the purpose of `**kwargs` and use it in your functions.
6. Efficiently handle named arguments in function definitions.

## Requirements

To successfully complete the "Almost a Circle" project, please adhere to the following requirements:

### Python Scripts
- Write Python scripts for this project.
- Use editors like `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` for coding.
- All your code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- Ensure that all your code files end with a new line.

### Shebang Line
- Start every code file with the following shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

### README.md
- Create a `README.md` file at the root of your project folder.
- This README should provide an overview of your project and its components.

### Coding Style
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide by using `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) for code formatting and styling.

### Executable Files
- All your code files should be executable.

### File Length
- Your code file length will be tested using the `wc` command.
