# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Recognize what an object is; an object is a fundamental concept in Python, where nearly everything, including data types, functions, classes, and modules, is treated as an object.
- Differentiate between a class and an object (or instance).
- Explain the difference between an immutable object and a mutable object.
- Comprehend what a reference is.
- Define an assignment.
- Identify what an alias is.
- Determine how to check if two variables are identical.
- Determine how to check if two variables are linked to the same object.
- Discover how to display the variable identifier (memory address in the CPython implementation).
- Recognize the concepts of mutability and immutability.
- List the built-in mutable types.
- List the built-in immutable types.
- Understand how Python passes variables to functions.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your files should end with a newline character.
- The first line of all your script files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### .txt Answer Files

- Only one line.
- No Shebang.
- All your files should end with a new line.
