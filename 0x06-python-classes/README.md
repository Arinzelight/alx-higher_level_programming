## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (using pycodestyle, version 2.8.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All your modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should not be just a single word, but a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
