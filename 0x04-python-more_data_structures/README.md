# Project: Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Learning Objectives

### General
- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Learn what sets are and how to use them.
- Familiarize yourself with common set methods and how to use them.
- Learn when to use sets versus lists.
- Discover how to iterate over a set.
- Understand what dictionaries are and how to use them.
- Learn when to use dictionaries versus lists or sets.
- Get acquainted with the concept of a key in a dictionary.
- Explore how to iterate over a dictionary.
- Learn about lambda functions.
- Understand the map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Requirements

### General
- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- Ensure all your files end with a new line.
- Begin each file with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Include a mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- Format your code according to PEP 8 using pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- Make all your files executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using wc.

In this project, you will learn about Python's more advanced data structures: sets and dictionaries. Sets are collections of unique elements, and dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. You will explore their usage, methods, and when to choose them over lists. Additionally, you will learn about iterating through sets and dictionaries, lambda functions, and functions like map, reduce, and filter, which are essential tools in Python's functional programming toolbox.

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of these data structures and when to apply them, making you more proficient in Python programming.
